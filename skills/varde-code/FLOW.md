# varde-code flow

Generated for human readers; agents do not load this file. Regenerate
with skill-flow.py --write from varde-agent-doc-authoring. Dotted edges
are conditional loads; min tokens follow only solid edges. Thick edges
are hand-offs to a later stage, outside min and max. Double-bordered
nodes are skill modes run inline or agent dispatches. Min and max count
this skill; main adds modes the main agent runs inline, each file once.
Subagents are per dispatch (multiply by the dispatch count); * marks a
conditional dispatch. Module overview first, then one diagram per module.
